# ESLint Management

Guidelines for enforcing code rules via ESLint.

## Prefer ESLint Over Documentation

Rules that can be enforced by ESLint (including custom rules) should be implemented in ESLint, not just documented.

## Regular Review

AI should periodically review and suggest ESLint rule improvements.
