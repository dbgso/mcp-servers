## MCP Tools Usage

**⚠️ DO NOT FORGET ⚠️**

Before starting any task, always run `mcp__mcp-interactive-instruction__description` and `mcp__mcp-interactive-instruction__help` to understand the MCP tools and check for relevant project rules.

Always use `mcp-interactive-instruction` MCP tools for any documentation operations in this project.

Never read or write files directly in the docs directory.
